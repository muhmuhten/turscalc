Battle Maison Damage Calculator
=======================

This is forked from the singles subtree of turksain's Battle Tree damage calculator (https://turskain.github.io), forked from Honko's official PokÃ©mon Showdown damage calculator (http://pokemonshowdown.com/damagecalc/), with changes made to improve the UX for the specific use-case of being used from a phone while piloting a PP-stall-heavy gen 6 singles team:

- Semi-responsive layout, it's not fantastic but at least operates without silly zooming on mobile
- Default to ORAS Singles (instead of USUM Doubles)
- Sort sets "Common" (set 4s and legendary 12s) > 41+ > others, with non-legendary sets in reverse order
- List custom sets *before* pre-loaded sets

Some of the code for the changes made were adaptations from Trainer Tower's damage calculator (https://trainertower.com/damagecalc/) made by Jake White, and cant say's/LegoFigure11's damage calculator based off of it (https://cantsay.github.io).
